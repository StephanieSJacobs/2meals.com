Note: be sure to enable Curl in php.ini file

What ive done.
-completely integrated with database for registering/logging in users
-if unregistered user tries to login with openid they are redirected to registration page
-updated database creation script:
	added create/use database lines at beginning of file
	made 'users'=>'id' auto_increment
	made deletion of User cascade to Donations - Question is key referenced in correct order for cascade delete?

Quick How-To for yii.

To build a page:
	-first design a model (protected/models)
	-design an actual page for that model (protected/views/site)
	-tell the controller (only file in protected/controllers) what to do when your site is called for by the Yii framework

also it helps to note that if you add/modify any components they are in the main.php of protected/config
	ex: the database host/name

Hopefully thats all you need to know! Just use whats there as an example
and if you need more info or help referrence the Yii site, the search tool there actually works really well!
